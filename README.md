# flutter_floor_map

## overview
I made a sample of using [photo_view](https://pub.dev/packages/photo_view) to put markers on a floor map. Pinch-in and pinch-out are functions of photo_view.  

The position of the markers is free. The floor map and marker images are also placed on the Stack. Each time you pinch in, pinch out, or scroll, the position is adjusted.  

The target file is only [main.dart](lib/main.dart).
